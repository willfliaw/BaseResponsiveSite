# Base Responsive Site

This repository contains a responsive website template designed to serve as a starting point for building adaptable and mobile-friendly sites. The structure follows best practices in modern web development, with modular and scalable CSS, simple HTML organization, and space for JavaScript enhancements.

This template is themed around a vibrant burger-focused design, inspired by a street/fast food market aesthetic. The project is based on a tutorial I followed, available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYFgtnKMDp4&t=6s). The goal of this template is to provide a reusable foundation for future food-related (or not) website projects.

## Project Overview

-   Focus: Mobile-first design
-   Key Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, basic JavaScript
-   Modularity: Separated CSS files (reset, base, components)
